# Hi, I'm Akshaj 👋

MS Computer Science @ University of Illinois at Chicago (GPA 3.9) — graduating May 2026.

I build AI-powered backend systems and LLM infrastructure. My focus is on the intersection of distributed systems and applied AI: RAG pipelines, LLM agents, real-time data processing, and scalable cloud infrastructure.

Previously built high-throughput backend systems at a startup processing 50K+ daily transactions. Now focused on shipping production-grade AI systems.

## What I'm Working On

- **[Conversational AI RAG Chatbot](https://github.com/realAkshaj/Conversational-AI-RAG-Chatbot)** — RAG pipeline over 500+ research papers using LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI. 85% answer accuracy, sub-2s response times.
- **[LLM Microservice](https://github.com/realAkshaj/LLM-Microservice)** — Scala-based microservice architecture for LLM inference at scale.
- **[AI CMS Platform](https://github.com/realAkshaj/ai-cms-platform)** — AI-powered content management system built in TypeScript.
- **[ML Model Serving](https://github.com/realAkshaj/)** — PyTorch models on AWS Lambda with SQS, handling 5K predictions/day at p95 < 300ms. ONNX optimization cut model size 50%.
